# World Happiness Report Analysis - Advanced Visualization Experiment (ADV_LAB2)
# Siddhesh Kirdat
## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the **World Happiness Report** data using various visualization and regression techniques. The analysis aims to uncover relationships between socio-economic factors like **GDP**, **Social Support**, and **Life Expectancy** across different regions.

## Aim
The goal is to visually represent and explore data relationships, trends, and patterns in happiness across countries and regions, using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Plotly**.

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the `ADV_EXP2.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to generate visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly

## Key Visualizations
- **Box Plot**: Happiness Scores by Region
- **Violin Plot**: Life Expectancy by Region
- **Regression Plot**: GDP vs. Happiness Score (Linear and Nonlinear)
- **3D Scatter Plot**: GDP, Social Support, and Life Expectancy

## Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is the **World Happiness Report 2024**.

## Inference
The analysis reveals that regions with higher GDP and social support, particularly in **Western Europe**, score significantly higher in happiness and life expectancy metrics. The positive correlation between GDP and happiness further validates this insight.

## Files
- **ADV_EXP2.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with code and visualizations.
- **World-happiness-report-2024.csv**: Dataset.
- **Output Visualizations**: Generated plots and charts.
